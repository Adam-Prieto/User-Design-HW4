## Background

For this assignment, we decided to analyze the "Worl Happiness Report" data set and see if we could gain any meaningful insights from the provided data. That said, here is our assignment. 

## User Questions - Adam

1.) I think that countries with higher levels of corruption would be ranked lower on the Social Development Ladder as a direct result of the government's incompetence and unwillingness to get things done. That said, I think that there would be a negative relationship between Corruption and Social Development (as corruption increases, social development decreases).

2.) As an inverse to my previous question, I think that Generosity and Life Expectancy would have a positive relationship since generous people would have less to think about and more social help from their peers, which would result in the aforementioned positive relationship. 

## Required Data and Comparissons - Adam

For my first user question, I would need to gather all of the non-null Corruption and SD Ladder data from the dataset, map the results in a scatter plot, and then mathematically calculate the correlation coefficient from the resulting data. Then, using human inference, I would need to determine if the corresponding graph and coefficient value map that of my first user question (does a negative correlation exist). If so, then my idea is worthy of further consideration and vice versa. 

For my second user question, I would follow all of the steps from my previous user question, but tweak the results to match a positive correlation -- that is, do the data points in my graph follow a steadily increasing, non-pleatuing, relationship in the graph and does a value greater than 0 (and preferably over 0.5) result from the data trend?
